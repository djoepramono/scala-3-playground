# Scala 3 Playground

Just a repository to quickly play around with Scala, in particular version 3.

To run, simply executes the provided sbt script and choose which package you want to run
```
./sbt
sbt:scala-3-playground> run
```

Alternatively you can also use runMain and the interactive shell can help you with autocomplete.
But this is not very user friendly, you would need to type it correctly from the first character to make it work
